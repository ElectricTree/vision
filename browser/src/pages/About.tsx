        <p>
          This is an artifact created by{" "}
          <a href="https://verses.xyz/">Verses</a>. Our first drop was the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.interdependence.online/">Declaration</a>, where
          we introduced the term &quot;pluriverse&quot;. With this artifact, we
          explore the origin of the term pluriverse in decolonial theory, and
          propose &#39;the Pluriverse&#39; as an alternative to the moncultural
          Metaverse.

          We hope this artifact equips readers with the knowledge necessary to
          understand the concept of pluriversality, and invites them into a
          participatory ecosystem to contribute meaning to the pluriverse.

          Adapted from Wikipedia: A pattern language is an organized and
          coherent set of patterns, each of which describes a problem and the
          core of a solution, The term was coined by architect Christopher
          Alexander in his 1977 book, A Pattern Language: Trees, Buildings,
          which remains one of the best-selling books on architecture. The
          authors thought that each pattern was analogous to a single word or
          thought of a true language, to be used as a building block, rather
          than a prescriptive way to solve a problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pluriverse Pattern Cards are modelled on Alexander&#39;s concept.
          They are intended to be a foundational set of patterns that may act as
          a starting point for future concepts and concretizations; as such, our
          &#39;seed set&#39; presented here is brief in comparison to the
          comprehensiveness achieved by other pattern languages. The cards use
          the below template:
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
