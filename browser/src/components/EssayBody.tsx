        I recognize myself not as something separate from Earth, but as an
        expression of it, along with all its living beings, systems and rhythms.
        Just like a flower does not sprout out of the meadow, but is the meadow
        manifesting its nature as a flower.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is from this holistic awareness of my being, that I vow to renew my
        relationship with Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        I declare my right to pursue a life unbound to an economy of extraction.
        A product of the maladaptive narratives of the past which have brought
        great destruction and suffering to life on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        I refuse to empower the forces of extraction with despair and innaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        I choose to walk towards a future of hope, renewal, healing and
        co-creation. A future, where the expression of humanity is not one of
        destruction but a steward for the blossoming of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that the creation of a regenerative economy is not only
        possible but necessary for human prosperity to thrive in harmony with
        the rhythms of our world.
      </p>
      <p className="py-8">
        <strong>
          I pledge here, today, to follow The Eden Way &mdash; The Eden Dao.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is to reject the doctrine of extraction and accept the path towards
        reconnection, regeneration, harmony and flourishing.
      </p>
      <p>
        To participate in kinship with all fellow humans in the co-creation of a
        regenerative economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, to devote my life to the manifestation of paradise on this my
        motherworld, Earth.
