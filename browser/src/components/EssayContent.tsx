        The heralds of this age promise digital freedom, immersion, and
        prosperity. But we have seen such promises before; we now know to be
        careful. Web1 gave us a new horizon of digital space, open, transparent,
        and interoperable—and yet, it was inaccessible to most, and growth
        brought with it fracturing and commercialization. Despite the looming
        walled gardens of today, Web2 began with its own dreams of
        democratization, heralded by proliferating personal websites,
        distributed network effects, and{" "}

For example: “BitTorrent thus demonstrates a key Web 2.0 principle: the service automatically gets better the more people use it. While Akamai must add servers to improve service, every BitTorrent consumer brings his own resources to the party. There's an implicit "architecture of participation", a built-in ethic of cooperation, in which the service acts primarily as an intelligent broker, connecting the edges to each other and harnessing the power of the users themselves.”`}

        alongside its technological foundations; one cannot create anew with the

Discussing the transformation of agricultural structure and labor in 16th-century England following land enclosures and the loss of the commons, Federici writes that communities lost sense of their social relations – “families disintegrated, the youth left the village to join the increasing number of vagabonds or itinerant workers…while the elderly were left to fend for themselves” (72). This was in stark (and disappointing) contrast to the rich social relations that existed in the commons, where peasant solidarity and sociality thrived and women, although possessing little social power, could experience autonomy.`}

        But we have brighter dreams, of brighter technological futures. Futures
        that are rooted in history, that prefigure infinite gardens of
        collective wisdom, intelligence, and collaboration. Futures where we
        move past promises of mere “freedom from” towards the shared capacity
        for building “freedom to.” Futures of <b>polycentrism</b>, where
        falsely-imposed scarcity and data moats give way to the creation of
        common and convivial spaces, collectively-owned resources and
        infrastructure, and shared, self-sovereign worlds. Futures of{" "}
        <b>plurality</b>, where choice is meaningful because difference and
        divergence are possible. Futures that trade in the flattening of a
        monoculture for a resilient ecology of diverse co-existence.

        These dreams are not new. In looking to the future, we look sideways to
        alternate timelines, and to the past. With each cycle of technological
        development, the stakes become higher. [tk technical, social, and
        methodological comments are required to bring this future about]

        Together, we can steward these new futures; we invite you to dream,
        collaborate, and strategize towards a different world. We propose to
        gather these worlds around a different banner: the

        Origins of the Pluriverse
      </h2>
      <p>
        A ‘pluriverse’ is <b>a world in which many worlds may fit</b>. The
        origins of the term are themselves plural. The word has its roots in
        decolonial theory, emerging from the Zapatista movement and taken
        forward by activists and academics alike, championed especially by the
        cultural anthropologist Arturo Escobar and the literary critic and
        theorist Walter Mignolo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pluriversality is a process of <em>decentering</em>. Birthed in response
        to the the neoliberal expansion of the 1990s, which had at its core a
        homogenous form of social organization as the driver of global
        capitalism, pluriversality instead re-centers other forms of being,
        knowing, and producing. The history of the term pluriverse is thus an
        oppositional one — those organizing under the banner of the pluriverse
        arrayed themselves against single, globalized Western system of being, a
        never-ending juggernaut of assimilation and monopoly over society
        itself. They advocated for financing mechanisms for the Global South
        separate from the predatory International Monetary Fund, pushed for
        workers’ cooperatives and collectively-owned modes of production, and
        fought for self-government, both through large-scale anti-colonial
        movements and small-scale community struggles for sovereignty.
      </p>
      <p>
        These advocates aimed to counter the universal - not with a disregard of
        all things universal, but with an embrace of ‘many universals’. We can
        see this not as a movement entirely away from the necessity of scale,
        but one that embraces federation and subsidiarity as well as one that
        requires many worlds to exist ‘at scale’ — pluricultures, not
        monocultures. Thus, the pluriverse arrays itself <em>against</em>{" "}
        universality as much as it is <em>for</em> plurality and epistemic
        diversity. It is for this reason that we believe it can act as an
        appropriate foundation for a socio-digital ecosystem — one that is built
        on collective negotiations of the future, and which makes space for
        generative encounters between plurals, both oppositional and
        collaborative.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pursuit of pluriversality is thus a process-oriented pursuit of a
        flowering of worlds. Grounded in the liberatory actions of autonomous
        communities, the pluriverse is a renegotiation of accepted binaries. The
        current digital space is being colonized by a single vision of what is
        possible. This vision constrains us, forcing upon us an extremely
        limiting and subjective view of how humans should be able to interact
        with each other through and on digital networks. Spurred on by the
        incentive structures of profit, growth, and control, the privatized web
        necessitates a flattening of our personhood, turning us into passive
        consumers—our power shifted to purchasing power, our selves shifted to
        durational performances meant to be consumed by others. Just as Escobar
        advocates for a displacement of the centrality of neoliberal and late
        capitalist constructs, the pluriverse is a vision for the digital future
        that makes way for a mosaic of communal, alternative, and autonomous
        cultural and economic worlds. This can expand the partial common ground
        and surface area of contact between these multiplicities, leading to a
        world of difference, but not disconnection.
      </p>
      <p>
        The digital pluriverse will cultivate the flourishing of many different,
        and potentially contrasting worlds.

        A Pattern Language For the Pluriverse
      </h2>
      <p>
        A pattern language is an organized and coherent set of <em>patterns</em>
        , each of which describes a problem and the core of a solution,
        illustrated with examples. The term was coined by Christopher Alexander,
        Murray Silverstein, and Sara Ishikawa in their 1977 book,{" "}
        <em>A Pattern Language: Trees, Buildings</em>, which contains hundreds
        of patterns aimed at encapsulating a philosophy of urban design,
        architecture, and community livability. These patterns range from the
        broad— ‘Mosaic of Subcultures’ calls for the necessity of overlapping
        and grounded subcultures within cities—to the highly specific:
        ‘Staircase Volume’ and ‘Corner Doors’.
      </p>
      <p>
        The authors of <em>A Pattern Language</em> analogized each pattern to a
        single word or thought of a true language, for use as building blocks in
        service of this cohesive whole. In this way, offering a pattern language
        is to{" "}
        <em>
          offer people agency in expressing and constructing their own solutions
        </em>
        , rather than a stand-alone or prescriptive way to solve a problem. This
        allows people to “solve the problem, in [their] own way, by adapting it
        to [their] preferences, and the local conditions at the place [they] are
        making it” (p xiii). Solutions are always contextual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired by this idea, as well as Escobar’s autonomous design
        principles, we lay out below a set of intentions and epistemes for
        pluriversality, modeled as the beginning of a pattern language for the
        pluriverse. Each pattern maps to and connects with the others, in what
        we hope will be a network that is both ever-expanding and
        ever-concretizing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This initial seed does not have the comprehensiveness and cohesiveness
        of the original work’s set. Alexander et al.’s architectural pattern
        language included 253 patterns, and was a result of decades of close
        observance of global architectural practice that had evolved and been
        experimented with over millennia. The digital realm for which we hope to
        design is nascent; while long-held lessons still hold sway, change is
        both seismic and regular. Collective input is both prefigurative and
        necessary to adapt to the speed and breadth of paradigm shifts inherent
        to the digital. Thus, rather than a meticulous and thorough provision of
        careful designs, we instead offer the kernel of a new set of patterns,
        and the beginnings of an architecture for collectively-created pattern
        languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our seed set is brief, but we invite you and others to plant and garden
        the seeds, so that this language may grow–evolving through intention and
        use, like all alive languages.
