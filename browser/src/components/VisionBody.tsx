    <p>
      Electric Tree is a decentralized climate finance platform and community
      built to bridge the climate financing gap and foster the development of
      emerging carbon removal technologies. We&rsquo;re here to empower
      individual contributions towards directly fighting climate change, through
      financing for disruptive climate tech companies at crucial stages of their
      development.
    </p>
    <h3 className="text-4xl mt-8 mb-1">The Climate Financing Gap</h3>
    <p>
      There&rsquo;s a critical financing gap in the world of climate tech. At
      the earliest Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), government and non-profit
      organizations offer non-dilutive grant funding. Later, as technologies
      mature, they attract investments from large corporate partners. However,
      in between these stages, there are few project financing options, which
      often slows down the growth and scaling of these promising technologies.
