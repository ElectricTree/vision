        Towards Digital Pluriverses
      </h1>
      <p>We are living in the age of the Metaverse. Or so we are told.</p>
      <p>
        Metaverse profiteers are everywhere, proselytizing commodified
        virtuality, colonizing open digital land for profit, and expanding the
        surface area of the digital sphere in lockstep with its capture. The
        Metaverse, led by Meta, acts as a monopoly, gating access to the length
        and breadth of the digital ecosystem through its congested and polluted
        chokepoints, taking what was once collective and ensuring it is bought,
        sold, measured, and speculated upon. The Metaverse expands as an
        invasive monoculture, assimilating ecosystems, displacing extant
        species, and enclosing digital abundance into enforced scarcity. The
        Metaverse we are handed is a shackles in disguise, the promise of a vast
        digital realm ruled under one banner, a shameless land grab for the
        commons of the future and the resources of the past. This is no
        Metaverse, this is a <b>monoverse</b>.

        But there are brighter dreams, of brighter technological futures. Dreams
        that do more than reclaim what has been lost; dreams that prefigure
        futures of plenty, that learn from the old and build cathedrals to
        collective wisdom and intelligence. That trade in promises of freedom
        from with invitations for freedom to. Futures of <b> polycentrism</b>,
        where resources are owned and governed by the many, and where false
        scarcity again gives way to the creation of common spaces,
        collectively-owned public infrastructure, and shared, self-sovereign
        worlds. Spaces of
        <b> plurality</b>, where choice is meaningful because difference is
        prized; all the better to create a resilient ecology of diverse
        co-existence. We propose these dreams and futures be gathered under a
        different banner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, we could instead steward the age of the <b>Pluriverse</b>.
